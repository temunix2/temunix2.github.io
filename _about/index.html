<p>My name is Ngawang Tsetan and I am a data scientist with a background in financial services. I recently completed a data science bootcamp called Metis and prior to that I was working at Morgan Stanley for ~3 years as a rotational analyst and a research associate. All the projects I have done are passion projects and are all topics that I am interested in deeply. Taking a look through my projects might tell you more about myself than any description I write here so please take a look through. Thanks for reading!</p>
