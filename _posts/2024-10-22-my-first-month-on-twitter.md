When I first joined Twitter, I decided to do something different. Instead of just adding to the noise, I wanted to share valuable insights. My choice? Charlie Munger's 25 psychological tendencies—a collection of wisdom that has shaped how I think about business and life.

## The Numbers Game

Starting with just 12 followers, I managed to grow my audience to 155 followers over the course of my Munger series. While I suspect a good portion might be bots (let's be honest, that's just Twitter), I'm grateful for the 5-10 genuine connections I've made along the way.

## Learning What Works

My journey taught me several valuable lessons about content creation on Twitter:

1. **Format Matters**: My early posts were text-heavy, and the engagement was disappointingly low. Even with 10-20 followers, including friends, the impression count was barely registering. This taught me the importance of presentation.

2. **Controversy Drives Engagement**: Interestingly, my most successful posts were about negative tendencies. Posts about "Dislike/Hating Tendency" and "Drug Misuse Tendency" received 46 and 32 views respectively—significantly higher than posts about more nuanced concepts.

3. **Engagement Strategy**: The best way to gain visibility? Meaningful interaction with larger accounts. When I thoughtfully engaged with popular posts—adding value or sharing relevant insights—my impressions spiked.

## A Personal Win

One highlight was when Greg Isenberg, whose podcasts I regularly listen to, responded to one of my comments. The key? Being early to the conversation and contributing something worthwhile. It was a small win, but it showed me that genuine engagement can lead to meaningful interactions, even with influential figures.

## Key Takeaways

For anyone starting their Twitter journey, here's what I learned:

- Keep your content concise and well-formatted
- Don't be discouraged by initial low engagement
- Focus on meaningful interactions with larger accounts
- Be authentic in your engagement
- Timing matters—early, thoughtful responses can lead to valuable connections

While my follower count might not be breaking any records, this experiment taught me valuable lessons about digital content creation and community building. Sometimes the real value isn't in the numbers, but in the learning process itself.

## Looking Ahead

But here's the twist—little did I know that everything I learned during this Munger series was about to pay off in a big way. Right after completing these posts, I published a tweet that would completely shatter my previous engagement records, jumping from 46 impressions to an astounding 24,000. But that's a story for another post...
