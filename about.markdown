Hey there! I'm Ngawang.

Welcome to my digital playground! I'm a data scientist with a finance background, currently diving into the world of fintech and AI.

## My Journey

I started in finance, graduating from Macaulay Honors College @ Baruch and working at Morgan Stanley. But the siren call of data was too strong to resist. I've since navigated through roles in data science and analytics, most recently as a Senior Data Scientist at Citizen.

## What I'm Up To Now

These days, I'm working on a stealth fintech project aimed at making banking more accessible. On the side, I'm tinkering with AI projects, including an exciting AI-powered group writing tool.

## When I'm Not Crunching Numbers...

You'll find me lost in sci-fi novels, working on my own book, or shooting hoops on the basketball court. Life's all about balance, right?

This blog is where I share my thoughts on data science, AI, fintech, and maybe the occasional book review or basketball hot take. It's a mixed bag, just like me!

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about data, swap book recommendations, or challenge me to a game of one-on-one. Looking forward to connecting with you all!

Remember: "Life is too short for boring data and predictable stories. Let's make both a little more exciting!"
