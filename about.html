		<h1>Hi there, I'm Ngawang Tsetan!</h1>
		<p>Hello, I'm Ngawang Tsetan, a versatile data scientist with roots in the financial services sector. I launched my data science career through Metis, a comprehensive bootcamp, after gaining foundational experience as a rotational analyst and research associate at Morgan Stanley.</p>
	  
		<p>This blog serves as my digital sandboxâ€”a platform where I explore, analyze, and discuss various projects that not only interest me but also contribute to broader conversations in data science and technology. My work is fueled by a genuine passion for leveraging data to solve real-world problems, whether it's enhancing financial models or improving public safety mechanisms. I invite you to browse through my projects; they offer a deeper insight into my skill set and aspirations than words alone can convey.</p>
	
		<p>Thank you for stopping by, and I'm looking forward to connecting with you.</p>
